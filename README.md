## CS 330 Stanford Fall 2021

My work for [CS 330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning at Stanford](https://cs330.stanford.edu/). Did this generally to help me get a better idea of what multi-task and meta-learning algorithms do in the contexts of few-shot supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Hopefully some cool research ideas come from this.

Generally a work in progress--not totally sure how well my HW4 does because I have a CPU and this course relies a lot on GPUs or Google Colabs to get results, so I haven't fully
tested out my HW4 stuff yet.
